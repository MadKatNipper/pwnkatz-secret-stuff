Note

The PwNK@tZ employee assistance program is REALLY something else! I didn't have enough KatBuckz to puuuuuuuuuuuurchase this week's supply of catnip. Understanding of my woes, the staff granted me a 1 week advance. PwNK@tz is really a great company to work for. 

I forgot to add a TODO of what we've been plotting. 


===TODO==== 
- force my authority to pet me with both hands (again). One handed petting is just... half .. of ... love... 
- move my ssh keys over to the infected host to facilitate easier file transfers and data exfiltration. 
- hunt down the mouse that's been creeping around in the C2 server room. 
- chase the red laser fairy around the living room with my Authority, ensuring that I knock over exactly two vases from the balcony while doing so.
