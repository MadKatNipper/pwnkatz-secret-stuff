Man, idk why boss always favors `madcatter` over me and `verociousfeline`... Sure, he catches more mice than us, and yeah he did successfully 
deploy the ransomware to that infected host, but he hasn't been keeping track of our progress on GitHub as well as we have. I think the boss will be 
very pleased to see that we have been keeping track of the most important updates. Maybe he'll give me a raise so I can get that new cactus scratching
post I've been eyeballing in isle 13 of the convenience store.

I digress. 

Heh, good ole' `Jane Doe` made our jobs so easy by clicking on that must-see-cat-picture phishing email we sent her. I don't blame her, 
it was rather enticing.
